For each preserved sample add 6ml media (RPMI+10% FCS) to a 15ml tube.

Defrost frozen samples in water bath at 37'C. Rinse with EtOH to clean
before transferring to tissue culture hood.

Pasteur all cells from sample into 6ml media, transfer back and forth to
rinse.

Centrifuge 15ml tube at 1200rpm 6 minutes to pellet.

Pour off supernatant and resuspend in 2ml media. Transfer into 25cm^2
flask.

Incubate overnight.

If cells are respirating effectively media will turn yellow. Add media
up to 5ml to culture.
