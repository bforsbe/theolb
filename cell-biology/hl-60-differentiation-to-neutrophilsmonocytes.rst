Methods
-------

Seed cells at 2.5x105 cells/ml as 4ml cultures in 25cm2 flasks.

If seeding to plates, seed to base-density of approximately 1x106
cells/25cm2 e.g. 1cm2 well = 3.14cm2 25/3.14 = 8 1/8 = 0.125 x 10^6
cells/well

Differentiation can be induced with 100nM ATRA (neutrophils) or 100nM
1a,25(OH)2D3 (monocytes)

Re-feed cells late on day 2 or morning day 3, ensuring stocks stay below
1x106/ml to avoid spontaneous differentiation

First signs of differentiation will appear day 3

Complete differentiation should be apparent day 5
