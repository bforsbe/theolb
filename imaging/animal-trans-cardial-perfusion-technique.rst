Animal Trans-cardial Perfusion Technique




    Pre requisites:
>
>* Animal ethics approval
>* Training in the safe handling of laboratory animals
>* Training in animal perfusion
>
>



Requirements
------------
Pre-perfusion buffer (for washing to clear blood vessels and open up the capillaries) Sodium Nitrite 0.01% in PBS pH 7.4
Fixative4% Paraformaldehyde +/-0.25% Acrolein (other fixatives can be used here)
Anesthetic see “NHMRC Guidelines to promote the well-being of animals used for scientific  purposes”


Method
------

- Set up the perfusion rig with fresh filtered solutions each time and ensure that all tubing is clean and free of blockages.

- Anesthetise the animal checking the foot pinch reflex to make sure it is fully anesthetised.

- Secure the animal on its back.

- Cut open the pericardium

- Pull the heart down to reveal the ascending aorta and insert the catheter into the ascending aorta.

- Clamp the heart at right angles to the catheter.

- Cut the right atrium.

- Make sure the pericardium does not occlude the venous outflow.

    The principle of perfusion is to start at a rate equivalent to cardiac output.

- Begin the perfusion by running the wash solution through to open the capillaries and wash the erythrocytes out of the tissue.

- Once cleared switch to the fixative.

- The run through time for the fixative should be 20 to 30 mins.

- Dissect out the brain and post fix for 24 hr (this may vary depending on the sensitivity of the antigen).
