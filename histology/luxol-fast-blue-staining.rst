Luxol Fast Blue histological stain. This technique is a method requiring over-staining of tissues and differentiation to reveal the myelin. It is advisable to include a control showing de-myelination pathology to ensure the end point of staining is reached. Cresyl Fast Violet counter-stain is optional and results in neuronal piliform staining and a deepening of the myelin blue staining.

    Cresyl Fast Violet counter-stain is optional and results in neuronal piliform staining and a deepening of the myelin blue staining.



Requirements
------------
Mounted sections on glass slides
Slide staining rack, Staining jars, Coplin jar
Absolute alcohol
Xylene
Distilled water.
DePeX
Luxol Fast Blue (Fronine: FG080)
Cresyl Fast Violet 0.2% (Fronine: HH155)
Lithium Carbonate (Sigma Aldrich: 62470)
0.05% Lithium Carbonate(aq)


Method
------

- Heat the staining solution to 60°C in the incubator (this will take 30mins approximately depending on the volume to be heated.

- Dewax or defat sections prior to rehydration as necessary. Rinse in tap water.

- Immerse the slides in the LFB solution and incubate at 60°C for 4 hours.

- Rinse off excess stain in distilled water

- Differentiate slides in Lithium Carbonate for 30 seconds

- Rinse in distilled water.

- Check staining microscopically and repeat steps 4 to 5 until myelinated and unmyelinated regions are defined.

- Counterstain with Cresyl Fast Violet for 8mins

- Dehydrate through 95% ethanol and check the Cresyl Fast Violet staining at that point. (70% ethanol will continue to remove the LFB).

- Dehydrate through absolute ethanol, clear in xylene and mount in DPX
