Immunostaining of Paraffin Sections








- Fix tissues for 3 hr on ice in 4% formaldehyde (2.5 ml of Polysciences #18814 made up to 10 ml in 80 mM NaPO4 [3.2 ml of 1 M NaPO4] pH 6.8 containing 0.2 gm of sucrose).  

- Wash for 2 hr in several changes of cool PBS.

- Infiltrate and embed in paraffin (use automatic processor).  Embed in flat end of capped Beem capsules 

- Prepare polylysine-coated slides by immersing clean slides, via a stainless steel slide rack, in 400 ml of 50 µg/ml polylysine (Sigma #P1524; make up in 10 mM Tris, pH 8) for 30 min.  

- Cover with foil and let dry overnight at room temperature.  Polylysine solution can be stored at -20°C and reused.  Store coated slides at 4°C and use within 4 wks. 

- Trim away excess paraffin so that block face is 2 - 3 mm2.  

- Set up on an ultramicrotome using glass knives or an old diamond knife with ‘boat’ filled with water.  Rapidly cut away surface paraffin, then cut 1 - 2 µm sections. 

    Sections cut easily and should form ribbons. 

- Pickup with the point of a 25 gauge needle and transfer to a drop of water on a polylysine-coated slide.  Have two groups of sections per slide.  Transfer slide to a 42°C warming plate and leave overnight. 

    Sections prepared in this manner can also be used for in situ hybridization

- Deparaffinize sections in xylene (2 x 10 min) using glass slide jars.  Transfer to 100% EtOH (2 x 5 min), and then to PBS (2 x 5 min). 

- Insert sections in Coplin jars containing ‘TUF’ (Target Unmasking Fluid; Signet Labs [Dedham MA] #1050) preheated to 80-90°C. 

- Incubate in TUF for 10 min at 80-90°C. 

-  Let jar cool 5 - 10 min, then rinse two times in ddH2O and two times in PBS.

- Place sections on a staining rack and block with PBS containing 1% BSA for 60 min at room temperature. 

- Pour off, dry with kimwipe around sections.  Add diluted (dilute in PBS containing 1% BSA; use 10 fold dilutions at start) antibody or preimmune control in one or two drops to sections

- Place slides in a closed 150 mm petri dish containing wet filter paper, and place overnight at 4°C.

- The next day, wash five times over 40 min in PBS containing 1% BSA. 

- At this time, can immerse in Pierce ‘peroxidase suppressor’ (Pierce #35000) for 30 min at room temperature.

- Wash several times in PBS containing 1% BSA using squirt bottle to carefully wash around sections. Dry around sections, then add one or two drops of secondary peroxidase-labeled antibody diluted 1/1,000 in PBS containing 1% BSA.

- Incubate for 60 min at room temp on staining rack. 

- Wash five times over 40 min in PBS using squirt bottle.

- Dry around sections, then add Pierce DAB metal concentrate (Pierce #1856090) diluted 1/10 in stable peroxide substrate buffer (Pierce #1855910). 

- Allow reaction to go for 5 - 15 min, then wash with ddH2O using squirt bottle. 

- Dehydrate slides in 80%, 90% and 2x 100% EtOH (1 min each), then immerse in 2 changes of xylene (1 min each).  

- Mount cover slips on the slides using Permount (Fisher) and examine in the light microscope.
