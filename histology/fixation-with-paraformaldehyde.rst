Fixation with paraformaldehyde








- Add 41.5ml 2.26% sodium dihydrogen orthophosphate to a suitable heat-proof container


- Add 8.5ml sodium hydroxide 2.52%


- Heat to 60-80'C in a covered container


- Add 2g 'Analar' paraformaldehyde, stirring thoroughly until dissolved. 

Adding a couple of drops of 1M NaOH can help the PFA dissolve.


- Allow to cool and filter to remove particulates. Recheck pH.


- Store at RT and ideally use within 48h.
