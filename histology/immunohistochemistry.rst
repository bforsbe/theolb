Requirements
------------
50 ml of 1xPBS pH 7.4
50ml of 1% BSA/PBS
Primary antibody: As recommended by manufacturer
Secondary antibody: As recommended by manufacturer â€“ Alexa dyes usually work best at 1:400



Method
------

- Cryostat sections are picked up on subbed slides (chrome-alum gelatin coated) and air dried for at least 2 hours.

Alternatively Superfrost or Poly-L-Lysine coated slides can be used. 


- Draw a circle around section with hydrophobic pen.

- Wash sections with PBS 3 times

- Incubate twice in 100% Ethanol for 2 minutes each.

Incubation for 20 min in PBS + 4% formaldehyde can be used as an alternative fixative.

- Block with BSA/PBS for 20 minutes.

- Add 1o antibody for 1 hour.

- Wash with BSA/PBS 3 times.

- Add 2o Ab for 1hr

- Wash with BSA/PBS 3 times

- Wash with PBS 3 times.

- A counterstain (e.g. DAPI or PI) may be added for a few minutes, followed by PBS washing.

- Mount with aqueous based fluorescent mounting medium (mowiol / prolong gold), dry edges, seal with nail polish.
