Immunohistochemistry (cultured cells and monolayers)




This protocol outlines a general method for immunohistochemical staining and can be adjusted to suit the antibodies used.




Requirements
------------
Fixative Use 4% PFA (sometimes kept as frozen 8% stock – add 2xPBS buffer to make up to 4%)
Blocking Buffer 0.5% BSA/PBS (e.g. 0.5g BSA in 100ml PBS) (% = g/100ml)
Permeabilisation Buffer 0.1% TX-100 in PBS    (e.g. 10% Tx-100 stock then 200µl in 20ml PBS)



Method
------

- Fix cells: 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH7.4 for 30-90 mins RT


- Wash gently x3 PBS


- Permeabilise cells with 0.1% TX-100 in PBS for 5mins


- Wash 2x in PBS


- Block for 10min in 0.5% BSA/PBS (but can be as long as you like)


- While blocking should make up primary antibody, dilute antibody in BSA/PBS, need 25-40ul/coverslip

*E.g. Antibody 1:50 = 2ul in 100ul BSA/PBS*



- Aliquot onto parafilm with sufficient space between coverslips


- Pick up coverslip and dry edges gently (touch corner to kimwipe) and place coverslip cells down onto antibody drop. Incubate for 60-90min RT


- Flip coverslip so cells face up and wash gently with BSA/PBS x 3


- Prepare secondary antibody (25-45ul/coverslip) and incubate for 45-60min       

*Many 2° Ab are used 1:400 (e.g. 1ul per 400ul) in BSA/PBS*



- Wash x3 BSA/PBS


- Wash x3 PBS
