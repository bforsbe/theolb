Tissue preparation for vibratome sectioning.








- Fix in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS pH 7.2-7.4.


- Remove excess fixative by washing tissues in PBS x 3.


- Embed in warm 40ºC 4% agarose in distilled water (dH20).


- Cool tissue blocks to 25ºC or until the agarose solidifies.


- Trim excess agarose away and attach blocks to metal chuck using cyanoacrylate adhesive.


- Cut sections to 30-50µm Vibratome sections.


- Collect sections in 0.1M PBS (add azide 0.05% for long term storage>1 week).
