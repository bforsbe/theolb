Fixation for flow cytometry with ethanol. This method is very simple, quick and
allows samples to be stored for weeks at –20°C.








- From a 35mm-10cm plate harvest cells with trypsin into a 15ml tube.

*Keep media as this helps to inactivate trypsin and many mitotic and dead cells will be floating in the media*



- Pre-chill  100% -20°C high grade Ethanol


- Centrifuge at low speed 1500rpm 10 minutes to pellet


- Remove supernatant media and resuspend in 1ml PBS


- Transfer to a 1.5ml eppendorf


- Centrifuge at 5000rpm for 2-5min to pellet


- IMPORTANT: Remove supernatant PBS and gently resuspend pellet in 300ul of PBS


- Add 700ul of 100% -20°C high grade Ethanol (EtOH) inverting tube a few times to ensure proper mixing and a good fixing of cells.


- Store at –20°C until required for flow cytometry/FACS
