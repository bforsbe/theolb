Alternative fixation procedure for FACS fixation, using formaldehyde fixatice.








- Fix cells with 2% fresh formaldehyde in PBS for 5-15min, gentle rotation may
help to improve fixation


- Wash cells 2-3 times with PBS to remove all of the formaldehyde


- Resuspend cells in 300ul of PBS 


- Add 700ul of 100% -20°C EtOH to permeabilize the cells - they can now optionally be stored for weeks at –20°C.


- Permeabilize cells with 0.1% TritonX-100 in PBS for 15min
