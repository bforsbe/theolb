Transformation of plasmid DNA to competent E. Coli cells








- Thaw competent cells on ice. 20–200µL per tube

- Add max. 20µL of a ligation reaction and mix _very_ gently

    When transforming purified plasmid into competent cells add just 1ul plasmid DNA solution.

- Incubate the tubes on ice for 30 min

- Heat shock the cells at 42'C for 45 sec to 2 mins

- Place the tubes immediately on ice for a further 2 minutes

- Add 800µL SOC medium to each tube

- Incubate for 1 hour at 37°C shaking vigorously 

- Spin down at 1200rpm for 5 minutes and remove supernatant

- Resuspend cell pellet in 200ul SOC medium by pipetting up and down

- Plate out the suspension on a LB agar plate containing the appropriate antibiotic.

    When transforming purified plasmid into competent cells plate out only 10–20µL bacterial suspension to the plate instead of all.

- Incubate the plates overnight at 37°C
