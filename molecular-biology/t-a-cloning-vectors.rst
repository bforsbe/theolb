A method for direct cloning a PCR product, by the T-vector technique. This is cheap and easy way to clone PCR products with A 3â€™ overhangs.








- Making the T-vector:
Digest 5 ug pBluescript II with EcoRV (blunt cutter). 


- Heat kill the enzyme or gel purify using Qiagen column elute in 50ul EB.


- Add 10 ul of 10X PCR buffer, 2 ul of 100 mM dTTP, 37.0ul of distilled water and 1.0 ul of Taq DNA polymerase. Incubate at 72 C for 2 hours. 


- Purify the T-vector by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation or purify over a Qiagen column.  Resuspend/elute the prepared T-vector in 100 ul of water or TE. We use about 2- 5ul in a ligation reaction.


- Cloning the PCR product:
Purify the PCR product over a Qiagen column (Gel purify if necessary). Elute in 50 ul EB. Use 5-10 ul of this PCR product in a ligation reaction e.g.

* 10ul PCR insert
* 5ul T-Vector
* 4ul 5X Ligase buffer
* 1ul T4 Ligase


- Ligate 15min RT(rapid ligation kit) to overnight (15C).


- Transform into E. coli (XL1Blue).


- Plate on Amp (75ug/ml) X-gal (spread 60ul of 2% solution on plate) Tet (15ug/ml) IPTG ( 0.1-1mM)


- Pick white colonies to prep.
