Methanol/Chloroform extraction of whole cell small molecular weight metabolites from cells in suspension.








- Pre-chill methanol on dry-ice


- Transfer cell culture to 15ml tube to wash.  


- Centrifuge at 1500rpm for 5 minutes to pellet. Add 5ml pre-warmed PBS, resuspend and repeat x2


- Centrifuge at 1500rpm for 5 minutes to pellet. Resuspend in 1ml pre-warmed PBS.


- Transfer cells to champagne flute glass vials. Centrifuge at 1200rpm for 5 minutes to pellet.


- Pre-chill centrifuge to 4'C.
Pre-chill chloroform and dH20 on wet ice.


- Completely remove supernatant PBS, then resuspend pellet in 400ul pre-chilled methanol. Place glass vials on dry ice to freeze rapidly. 

OPTIONAL: Samples may now be stored at -80'C until required.


- Pipette 325ul dH20 via pipette onto each sample.


- Syringe 400ul chloroform  via Hamilton syringe onto each sample (chloroform will digest plastic).


- Keep samples at 4'C for 10 minutes to allow phases to separate.


- Centrifuge at 1200rpm for 10 minutes at 4'C in swingout rotor.


- Transfer vials to the bench at room temperature for 5 minutes.


- Remove ~400ul upper (polar) layer into eppendorf using by pipette.


- Remove ~200ul lower (non-polar) layer into glass vials using Hamilton syringe.


- To dry samples for re-suspension in analysis buffer, place samples in vacuum dryer. Polar fraction will dry within 3-4 hours.
