Titration of retrovirus lines.

Note, target cells must be dividing to be infected. As the viral RNA/protein complex cannot enter the nucleus entry must wait for nuclear membrane to dissolve at mitosis.








- The day before infection set up J2-3T3s in 6-well plates. 

J2-3T3s are recommended as they provide discreet colonies after selection

*Some retrovirus cannot be titred on rodent cells such as 3T3. For example, packaging lines using the gibbon ape leukaemia virus (GALV) env protein must be titred on human cells.*



- Check cells are 20-80% confluent on the day of infection



- Prepare 6ml/titration of [DMEM + 9ug/ml polybrene] in a 50ml universal tube e.g. for 3 titrations prepare 18ml.

Polybrene is hexadimethrine bromide (Sigma H9268). Final concentration should be 6ug/ml. Store polybrene stock of 3mg/ml in PBS at 4C.


- For each titration set up 6 Eppendorf tubes each containing 800ul of DMEM, labelled 1-6.



- Add the 200ul of supernatant to Eppendorf no.1 and mix by inverting several times


- Transfer 200ul from Eppendorf 1 to Eppendorf 2 and mix by inverting.


- Continue through all 6 tubes producing a serial dilution.


- Refeed the J2-3T3s with 1ml/well of [DMEM + 9ug/ml polybrene]


- Add 0.5ml from each Eppendorf to each of the wells 1-6.


- Incubate cells overnight at 37'C to start infection. Select the following day.


- For G418; use 600ug/ml in DMEM, it takes around a week to get the result.  
For Puromycin; use 12ug/ml in DMEM, it can take several days to get the result.

To avoid counting colonies down the microscope remove media and let the plate dry overnight. You can then score colonies visually.
