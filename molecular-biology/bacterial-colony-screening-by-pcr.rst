One of the fastest way to screen bacterial colonies. 

With a PCR machine that takes 24 tubes you can routinely screen 22 colonies + 1 negative + 1 positive control. 








- Plan your primers.

*Ideally you want a primer pair that can only work if the correct construct is present eg. a vector flanking primer and a gene specific primer. However, this may not allow you a positive control (essential) so you might have to use both vector flanking primers instead. If you have enough space in your PCR machine you could do both. *



- Set up 24 PCR tubes each containing 5ml H2O. 


- Touch a fresh toothpick (or yellow tip) onto a colony, dip it into a PCR tube, then streak it onto a fresh replicate agar plate using a numbered template (that is, all 24 colonies on a single agar plate). 


- Repeat this for all colonies.

For negative control use a colony that is negative (or use nothing).

For positive control use a colony that will yield a product with your primers. If you don't have a +ve colony then use a tiny amount of plasmid DNA


- Incubate the replicate agar plate at 37C overnight.


- Set up an appropriate number of PCR pre-mix as follows (e.g. 25x):

1 x pre-mix||25 x pre-mix
-|-|-
11.5ul|H2O|287.5ul
2ul|10 x PCR buffer|50ul
0.6ul|MgCl2 (50mM)|15ul
0.5ul|10mM dNTPs (i.e. a mixture of all four at 10mM each)|12.5ul
0.1ul|primer 1 (100mM)|2.5ul
0.1ul|primer 2 (100mM)|2.5ul
5ul|Template|- ul
0.2ul|cheap Taq|5ul


- Add 15ml of pre-mix to each PCR tube. 


- Set up PCR programme as follows:

Cycles|Temperature|Duration
-|-|-
1|94C|60 seconds
25|94C|30 seconds
55C|30 seconds
72C|1 minute


- While the PCR is running prepare the agarose gel ready to analyze the PCR products.


- When you have the result you can go to the replica agar plate on the same day and set up miniprep cultures of the likely candidate colonies.
