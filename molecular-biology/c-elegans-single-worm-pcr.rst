Single Worm PCR for use with C. elegans






Requirements
------------
Lysis Buffer* 1 X PCR buffer (see below for 10X PCR buffer)
Proteinase K: 20 mg/ml
10X PCR Buffer: 100 mM Tris, 500 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2 pH 8.3
dNTP mix: 25 mM/each
Primers: 5-10 uM
Taq Polymerase: approx 5U/ul 


Method
------

- Add proteinase K to 1 X PCR buffer  (95 ul 1 XPCR buffer + 5 ul 20mg/ml proteinase K)

*We do not use the "Lysis buffer" recipe anymore because 1 X PCR buffer seems to work fine. *



- Place 5-10 ul  of 1 X PCR buffer + proteniase K  in top of 200 ul PCR tube (if you use more than 1 worm use 10ul instead) 


- Pick single worm (or  multiple worms) into lysis buffer. 


- Immediately (don't let sit too long in lysis buffer)  spin down to bottom of tube by spinning in microfuge 15 seconds @ 14,000 rpm or just flick down. 


- Freeze tube in Liquid Nitrogen  at least 10min. 


- Lysis of worm and release of genomic DNA (You can use the PCR machine --"worm lysis" program)

* Heat tube to 65 degrees for 60-90 minutes
* Inactivate proteinase K by heating to 95 degrees for 15 minutes.  If you do not use the worm DNA right away store at -80C. 


- Perform PCR (50ul reaction)

* Add 45-40 ul l of PCR "master mix" to each tube
* Master mix: 1X PCR Buffer, 0.5 uM primers, 0.2 mM/each dNTPs
* Add 0.5ul of Taq to tubes at 95C (hot start) If you have many samples the master mix can include the Taq so you can skip this step.
* Run PCR reaction for 30-35 cycles
