Preparation of Competent XLI-Blue MRF’ Cells (ref. p. 1.76 of Maniatis)








- Streak XLI-Blue MRF’ (#1059; in Box 1A of Locator) cells from frozen stock onto Super Optimal Broth (SOB) agar plate.  Incubate overnight at 37°C.


- Transfer 4-5 colonies (1-2 mm diameter) into 1 ml of SOB containing 20 mM MgSO4.  


- Disperse by vortexing at moderate speed, then dilute culture in 100 ml of SOB containing 20 mM MgSO4 in a 1 l flask (use flask reserved for preparation of competent cells).


- Grow to OD600 of 0.45 -0.5 (equals approx. 108 cells/ml; check OD600 every 30-60 min).


- Dispense cells into (2) 50 ml prechilled conicals.  Cool cultures for 10 minutes on ice.


- Spin for 10 minutes at 2,000 rpm (Beckman GS6R centrifuge; 4°C).  


- Pour off supernatant, then leave inverted for 1 minute to remove all supernatant.


- Resuspend pellets in 20 ml/tube of ice-cold transformation buffer by gentle vortexing.  Place on ice for 10 minutes.


- Spin for 10 minutes at 2,000 rpm (Beckman GS6R centrifuge; 4°C).


- Pour off buffer.  Invert 1 min to remove all buffer.  


- Resuspend in 4 ml/tube of ice-cold transformation buffer by gentle vortexing.


- Add 140 µl/tube of DMSO.  Mix gently by swirling and store on ice for 15 minutes. 


- Add an additional 140 µl/tube of DMSO.  Mix gently by swirling and place on ice. 


- Quickly dispense 300 µl aliquots into prechilled sterile 1.5 ml screw top tubes.  Immediately snap freeze by immersing in liquid N2.


- Store until needed.  Before use, thaw one aliquot to check for transformation efficiency using pUC18.
