Basic proteinase K treatment








- Aliquot an appropriate volume of 10mM Tris-HCl


- Add 1mM EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid)


- Add 1% v/v Tween 20 


- Add 0.1mg/ml proteinase K


- Mix solution thoroughly then adjust to a pH 8.0 as appropriate with ,magnetic stirrer


- Incubate sample overnight at 37'C.

Longer incubations and higher concentrations of proteinase K will improve DNA quality and yield from fixed tissue sections.


- Boil sample in solution for  8 minutes to inactivate the proteinase K. Sample is now ready for PCR.
