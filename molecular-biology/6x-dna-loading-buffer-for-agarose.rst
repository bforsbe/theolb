Easy to use, add 2ul per 10ul of DNA solution.




    Ficoll 400 performs better than glycerol or sucrose based loading buffers.
>
>EDTA and SDS are included as enzyme inhibitor and protein denaturant respectively, they help sharpen up bands a bit.
>
>Orange G is the dye of choice as it won't obscure smaller DNA bands like other dyes.

Requirements
------------
1.	Ficoll 400 
2.	0.5 M EDTA solution
3.	10% SDS solution
4.	Ultrapure H20
5.	Orange G crystals



Method
------

- Combine the following in a 50ml falcon tube (you'll need the extra space for mixing)

1.	2.5 g Ficoll 400 
2.	400 ul 0.5 M EDTA
3.	18 ul 10% SDS
4.	Ultrapure H2O to 10 mls


- Add a small pinch of Orange G (Don't use your fingers). You're aiming for a deep orange colour. 


- Leave on a shaker/shaking incubator for an hour or so (it takes a while to dissolve)

- Once dissolved it's ready to use. Store at RT, lasts forever.
