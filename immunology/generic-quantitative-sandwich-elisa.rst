A generic ELISA protocol with optional quantitative step.








- Dilute primary antibody in coating buffer solution allowing for 50ul/well. A total of 5ml/96 well plate will provide spare for pipetting inaccuracy.

- Coat Nunc Maxisorp plate with primary antibody solution at 50ul/well. Tap gently to ensure the bottom of each well is completely covered.

- Incubate plate overnight at 4'C

- Flick off primary antibody and blot plate on tissue.

- Block plate with 200ul blocking buffer/well. A total of 20ml/96 well plate.

- Incubate the plate at room temperature for 1hr

- For quantitative ELISA prepare standards of target antigen in culture medium.

Perform serial dilutions from high of 2000pg/ml down to 31.25pg/ml, with final 1x blank culture medium alone.

- Wash the plate x6 with PBS/1% Tween. After final wash tap out plate and blot dry.

- Add supernatants (and optional standards) at 50ul/well. A 1/10 dilution plate can be produced by adding 45ul wash buffer + 5ul supernatant.

- Incubate at room temperature for 2-4 hours

- Flick off samples and standards into Vercon for disposal

- Wash the plate x6 with PBS/1% Tween. After final wash tap out plate and blot dry.

- Dilute secondary biotinylated antibody in blocking buffer to a volume for 50ul/well (5ml/96 well plate).

- Add 50ul of diluted secondary antibody/well

- Incubate at room temperature for 1-2 hours

- Flick off secondary antibody to disposal

- Wash the plate x6 with PBS/1% Tween. After final wash tap out plate and blot dry.

- Dilute Extravidin peroxidase with blocking buffer at 1/1000 to a total volume of 50ul/well (5ml/96 well plate).

- Add extravidin peroxidase to plate at 50ul/well

- Incubate at room temperature for 1/2 hour

- Wash the plate x8 with PBS/1% Tween. After final wash tap out plate and blot dry.

- Add 100ul TMB substrate per well (10ml/96 well plate)

- Leave at room temperature for ~20 minutes or until top standard has saturated.

- Stop reaction with 1M HCl at 100ul/well

- Measure abosorbance on plate reader.
