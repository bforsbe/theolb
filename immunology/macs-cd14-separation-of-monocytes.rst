Isolation of CD14+ subset of monocytes by MACS magnetic bead isolation.








- Centrifuge whole cell population at 1200rpm 10 minutes to pellet cells

- Remove supernatant and resuspend in 80ul MACS buffer per 10^7 cells

- Add 20ul CD14+ MACS beads per 10^7 cells

- Mix thoroughly and incubate for 15 minutes at 4'C

- Wash in 1-2ml buffer per 10^7 cells and then centrifuge at 1200rpm 10 minutes to pellet

- Resuspend in 500ul buffer per 10^8 cells (5ml/10^7)

- Place MACS column in magnetic field (in stand) and rinse through with 3mls MACS buffer

- Add cell suspension to column, allow to run through collecting run-off as waste

- Wash 3x 3ml with buffer, collecting run-off as waste

- Remove column to collection tube. Add 5ml buffer wash through and plunger to collect

- Count resulting cells and purity check by flow cytometry
