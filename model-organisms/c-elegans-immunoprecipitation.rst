Immunoprecipitation protocol for use with C. elegans worm lysate








- Preparation of worm lysate:

* Add 2 ml of PLC buffer to 0.25 ml of worm pellet.
* Break up the worms by sonicating.
* Spin 10 minutes @ 13000 g in microfuge, save supernatant.


- Quantitate protein in lysate using Pierce BCA kit.


- Wash 100 ml (actually 10 ml of beads since it comes as a 10% suspension) of Protein A Sepharose in PLC buffer. Spin 3 minutes @ 13000 g in microfuge.


- Immunoprecipitate using 1 mg of lysate protein (may have to use more depending on the protein you’re looking at) mixed with 5 mg of antibody and 10 ml of the washed Protein A Sepharose. Total volume of the mixture should be 1 ml.


- Incubate on a rocker platform at 4ºC for 1 hour.


- Wash 3x with 1 ml of PLC buffer.


- Add 50 ml 1x sample buffer.


- Boil 5 min.


- Load 20 ml on  an SDS PAGE gel.
