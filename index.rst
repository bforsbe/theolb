Welcome to The Open Lab Book
============================

The OLB is a collection of open, freely-available lab protocols collected, with permission,
from across the internet. The list has been available in various formats and on various
sites over that time, but finally finds a home here.

Authors are credited where known emdash; currently in the source, with homepage links in the 
rendered output where available. Contributions of new protocols or amendments or corrections 
to existing ones are most welcome and can be made via the `github repository <http://github.com/mfitzp/theolb>`__.
