Tear Collection Method; Scot Bower and Denise Sediq 4.13.09 developed from Jones 1997








- After informed consent, the tear sample should be collected from one eye (left eye) of each subject. Subject's wearing contact lenses must remove their lenses and wait 5 minutes before proceeding with the tear collection procedure.


- For basal tear collection instil one (1) drop of 0.5% proparacaine on the cornea and conjunctiva. 


- Instruct the patient to sit with eyes gently closed for 2 minutes before tear collection.


- Tear collection will be accomplished by using a 2.0 mm x 10.0 mm polyester  fiber rod (Transorb Wick, Filtrona, Richmond, VA) as previously described [Jones 1997]


- Place the wick in contact intermittently with the tear fluid at the lower cul-de-sac for a minimum time to obtain fluid without irritating the subject's eye (30 to 60 seconds)


- Place the collection wick gently into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube, and freeze at -70 C for storage.
