Silica-based Plasmid Miniprep (vacuum manifold version)






Requirements
------------
GTE: 50 mM Glucose, 25 mM Tris 8.0, 10 mM EDTA  RNAse A (0.1mg/ml)
Lysis Buffer: 200 mM NaOH, 1% SDS (prepare fresh)
4.0 M KOAc: (pH 5.5 with acetic acid)
Silica Suspension: resuspend immediately before use by shaking vigorously
Wash Solution: 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris 7.5, 2.5 mM EDTA, 50% Ethanol


Method
------

- Prepare Silica Suspension

* Suspend 2-10  grams of Silica (Sigma S-5631) in 20 mls H2O and allow to settle for 2 hours
* Remove milky supernatant and suspend settled silica in 20 mls H2O and allow to settle
* Repeat two more times
* Estimate volume and resuspend silica in 2 vols 6M Guanidine Hydrochloride-1M KOAc buffer, pH 5.5.



- Lyse bacteria

* Pellet 1.5 mls culture in microcentrifuge tube 10 sec @ 14,000 rpm
* Resuspend cells in 200 ul GTE
* Lyse cells with 200 ul lysis solution for 1 minute
* Add 200 ul KOAc and mix by inversion
* Remove debri by centrifugation 10 minutes @ 14,000 rpm
* Put a cleaned Qiagen mini prep1 column on manifold (i.e. QIAvac 24 Cat#19403) and load  200ul of silica suspension. Do not have the vacuum on at this stage


*We use the used Qiagen columns from the mini prep and gel extraction kits. To clean these columns pass 1-2ml H20 (65C) followed by 0.5ml EtOH wash.*



- Isolate plasmid DNA

* Transfer the supernatant to the silica slurry and mix by pipetting.
* Turn on vacuum and Wash 2X 1ml Wash solution.
* Spin the column 1min high speed to dry (this is very important)
* Elute the plasmid DNA with 50 to 100ul  H2O or EB. Yields approx 100-200 ng/ul plasmid DNA
