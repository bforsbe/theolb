1 M HEPES, pH = 7.0 






Requirements
------------
119.15 g HEPES (free acid)
Distilled water
Solid NaOH pellets
Concentrated NaOH


Method
------

- Add 119.15 g HEPES (free acid) to a suitable container and make up to 400ml with distilled water.

- Add solid NaOH a few pellets at a time while mixing until the pH is ~6.8

- Add concentrated NaOH dropwise to achieve pH = 7.0

- Add distilled water to a final volume of 500 ml

- Sterile filter and store for later use.

    Store at 4oC
