Prep for cosmids or low copy number plasmids.






Requirements
------------
LB: 10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 10 g NaCl per liter (pH to 7.0)
Resuspension buffer: 50 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)
Lysis buffer: 200 mM NaOH, 1% SDS
4 M KOAc: pH to 5.3 with glacial acetic acid
Qiagen tip-100
QBT buffer:0.75 M NaCl, 50 mM MOPS, 15% isopropanol, 0.15% TritonX-100 (pH 7.0)
QC buffer:1.00 M NaCl, 50 mM MOPS, 15% isopropanol (pH 7.0)
QF buffer:1.25 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris, 15% isopropanol (pH 8.5)
Isopropanol
70% ethanol


Method
------

- Grow up cells from which to purify DNA

* Innoculate 100 mls LB + appropriate antiobiotic with 1 ml saturated culture
* Grow overnight or to saturation
* Spin down cells 7' @ 5000K (SLA-1500 rotor)
* Resuspend cells in 5 mls resuspension buffer - make sure cells are thoroughly resuspended
* Transfer cell suspension to 50 ml conical tube


- Lyse cells to release cosmid DNA

* Add 5 mls fresh lysis solution and invert gently twice to mix
* Incubate on ice for 5 min
* Add 5 mls 4 M KOAc and invert gently 2-3 times to mix
* Incubate on ice for 10 min
* Prepare an empty 50 ml syringe barrel by pluging a KimWipe into the bottom
* Place syringe over clean 50 ml conical tube
* Dump cell lysate into syringe and allow clarified solution to drain into 50 ml conical tube while the precipitate will be captured atop the KimWipe
* Add RNase to 50 ug/ml and let sit at room temperature while equilbrating Qiagen column
