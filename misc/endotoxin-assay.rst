- Prepare endotoxin standard curve. Take 100 µl of 12 EU/ml endotoxin up to 1000 for 1.2 EU/ml.  Place in wells of an Immulon 2 (Dynatech; ELISA plate) the following:

EU tx|0|.012|.02|.03|.06|.09|.12
-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
Endotox (µl)|0|10|16.7|25|50|75|100
LAL Reagent (µl)|50|40|33.3|25|45|42.5|40

* Use endotoxin-free (‘LAL Reagent’) water for all dilutions.  Charles River provides endotoxin at 12 EU/ml (after reconstitution with 1.5 ml ‘LAL Reagent’ water. Vortex to reconstitute and vortex immediately before use.  Store at 4ºC for up to 2 wks after reconstitution (should test to see if we can freeze aliquots).*



- Prepare test samples (µl of 1 nM lacritin [= 12.3 ng/ml of pRB2] or 1 nM lacritin fragment, or of current working concentration):

Sample (µl)|5|25|50
-|-|-|-
LAL Reagent (µl)|45|25|0




- Incubate in 37°C incubator for 5 min. 


- Add 50 µl of ‘LAL Solution’ and mix on rotating platform in 37°C incubator for 18 minutes.


- Add 100 µl of ‘Substrate-Buffer Solution’ mix on rotating platform in 37°C incubator for 8 minutes.
 


- Read on plate reader at 405nm. Look at analyzed graph to get EU values for test samples and see standard curve.  Divide by volume applied.
