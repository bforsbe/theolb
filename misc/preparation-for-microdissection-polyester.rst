Basic protocol for Eosin & Haematoxylin histological preparation of microdissection slide.








- Place slides in 100% ethanol for 5 minutes


- Transfer slide to 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, then 70% ethanol; 30 seconds/step


- Transfer slide into de-ionized water


- Transfer slide into Mayer's Haematoxylin


- Return to de-ionized water to rinse for 15 seconds x2 changing dH20 between steps


- Transfer slide to 70% ethanol


- Transfer slide into Eosin Y


- Return to de-ionized water to rinse for 30 seconds x2


- To reduce brittleness of tissue, place in 3% glycerol in de-ionized water


- Shake and air dry to remove layer of glycerol and water


- Microdissection is best performed in the following 5-10 minutes following preparation. If if tissue dries return tissue to 3% glycerol/water; step #10
