Heparanase Detection method for Western Blotting








- Generate cell lysates (use ‘Lacritin Affinity Binding of SDC1’ lysis buffer).  

- Dialyze lysates overnight against binding buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7) and apply to a HiTrap heparin affinity purification (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway NJ).

- Wash with 10 column volumes of binding buffer, then elute using 5 column volumes of elution buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, 2 M NaCl, pH 7).  

- Determine protein concentration by BCA

- Analyze by 10% SDS-PAGE. Detect HPSE with rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against human heparanase (kindly provided by Israel Vlodavsky, Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Haifa, Israel) 

- Add HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL.
