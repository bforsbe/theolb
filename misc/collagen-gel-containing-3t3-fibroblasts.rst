Collagen gel containing 3T3 fibroblasts (dermal equivalent for raft culture)








- Pre-chill pipettes and place 12mL rat tail type 1 collagen (>3.8mg/mL) on ice

*Everything is kept cold to avoid the collagen solidifying*



- Mix 1.5mL of 10x DMEM with 1.5mL of 10x reconstitution buffer, keep on ice.


- Count J2-3T3s and pellet required number in a universal.


- Add the 3mL of [1:1, 10x DMEM and 10x reconstitution buffer] and swirl to resuspend the cells, keep on ice.


- Using chilled pipette, add the 12mL of collagen gently to the cells and tilt to mix, avoiding bubbles as far as possible.


- Add 10N NaOH to bring the pH up to 7

*You may judge the pH visually by the phenol red in the DMEM. Approximately 30–60mL will be required. Use the glacial AcCOOH if necessary but more mixing means more bubbles.*



- Pipette 2–2.5mL into each well and incubate O/N


- Add 2mL raft media on top of each matrix.


- Use within 1 week, change media every 2 days.
