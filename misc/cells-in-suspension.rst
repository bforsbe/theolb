DAPI counterstain of cells in suspension, e.g. for FACS analysis








- Dilute stock DAPI mix to a concentration of 3uM in staining buffer, allowing a total of 1ml per sample.


- Centrifuge cell suspension at 1200rpm for 5 minutes to pellet. Pour off supernatant.


- Tap/agitate to dislodge and re-suspend cells in remaining buffer. 


- Add 1ml of diluted DAPI to each sample


- Incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature


- Analyze cells as required:

For *flow cytometry* leave cells in DAPI solution.

For *fluorescence microscopy* pellet cells by centrifugation, remove supernatant and resuspend in PBS. Add a drop of cells to a slide and cover with coverslip.
