LB agar plates for cloning




    Batch makes about 40 plates.



Requirements
------------
Special Additives (to be added to LB Agar right before pouring plates) 
Ampicillin (VWR 80055-786) 50 mg dissolved in a small amout of dH2O (concentration 100 ug/mL)
X-gal (VWR IB02260)

Stock solutions
50 mg dissolved in a small amouth of DMSO
200mg in 10mL dH2O (store at 4 in 1mL aliquots) use 100mM 238 mg IPTG in 10mL dH2O (store at –20
Ampicillin 20mg/mL
50uL on each plate
IPTG (VWR EM-5800)
in 1mL aliquots) use 40uL on each plate
X-gal 40 mg/mL 400 mg X-gal in 10mL DMSO (store at –20 in 1mL aliquots foil wrapped tubes) use 40uL on each plate


Method
------

- Add 250 mL of dH2O to a graduated cyclindar.

- Weigh out 20g of premix LB Agar powder (VWR DF0445-17) or:
* 5.0 g tryptone
* 2.5 g yeast extract
* 5.0 g NaCl
* 7.5 g agar


- Mix powder well to bring into solution

- Add dH2O to total volume of 500 mL and transfer to 1 L flask

- Put on stirring hot plate and heat to boil for 1 min while stirring.

- Transfer to 1 L pyrex jar and label with autoclave tape.

- Autoclave at liquid setting for 20 minutes in a basin making sure to loosen top

- Let agar cool to ~55C (you should be able to pick up the jar without a glove)

- Add your antibiotic at this point.

- Make sure bench top has wiped down with bleach/EtOH.

- Remove sterile Petri dishes (VWR 25384-208) from plastic bag.

    Save the bag for storage

- Pour a thin layer (5mm) of LB Agar (~10mL) into each plate being careful to not
lift the cover off excessively.

    You should be able to just open up enough to pour.

- Swirl plate in a circular motion to distribute agar on bottom completely.

- Let each plate cool until its solid (~20 minutes) then flip so as to avoid
condensation on the agar.

- Store plates in plastic bags in fridge with: name, date and contents

    Note any additive
